The simple way to develop MVDs
------------------------------

###Prerequisites

Make sure you have GNU make, JDK8 or later, and Mirah installed.

Get the BIMserver jar files.

Make a new directory to put your MVD in.

There is an example Makefile in this directory; you can use environment variables to configure it, or directly wire in the values for the locations of all the files it needs.

Getting a build environment set up is covered in the file `INSTALL.md` in this directory.
